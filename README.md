# 2D-PLOTTER
I made a 2d plotter in my junior year project.
XY Plotter is an embedded system that works based on the principal Computer Numerical Control. XY Plotter basically works with two stepper motors and a servo motor, wherein the robot plots the input given from the computer on the drawing board using a microcontroller on a open-source physical computing platform Arduino. The XY plotter has a two-axis control and a special mechanism to raise and lower the pen. Each axis is powered and driven by using an Arduino compactable driver. The plotter works more efficiently, which is used to recording or plotting two-dimensional data on a rectangular coordinate system. In this, Arduino compatible main board with two stepper motors for ease moving of pen holder and servo motor is used to lift the pen. For this we are using the software like Arduino IDE software and G code converter. This improves the efficiency which produces large and complex drawings.
